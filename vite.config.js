Return JSON {"hazard": string, "plan": string, "roi": string}, each 2-3 sentences, max 60 words:
- hazard: who is exposed to what heat and air quality right now, and where.
- plan: what the budget funds, where, and why these roofs beat a uniform rollout. If measure_order is given, present the measures in that order.
- roi: payback, peak grid demand cut, and health/equity outcome.

  rank: (facts) => `You advise a city council on which building retrofit measures to fund first in one suburb.
Each measure below comes with totals computed over the suburb's buildings. Pick the best 3, best first, weighing payback, yearly saving,
buildings reached and vulnerable buildings reached (schools, health, aged care nearby, older residents) against the suburb's heat and people.
